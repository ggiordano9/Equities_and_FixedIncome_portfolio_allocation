# Project_3_Team_1
The overall idea for this project is to create an online interactive portfolio. In addition, we will take in information from Twitter and other forms of media to understand how to format our sharpe, calmar, sortino, treynor ratios for market evaluations. Once we have the analysis, we will determine what daily return information we can get based on the standard deviation and other financial metrics. One feature we will try to incorporate for this project is to use federal and state taxes to provide a recommendation for how much a person should invest in fixed income (corporate bond vs municipal bond) based on their age and financial background.
